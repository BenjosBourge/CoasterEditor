# CoasterEditor

CoasterEditor is a prototype coaster editor built using the Godot Engine. This tool was created to explore an idea that spontaneously came to mind. Now that I am satisfied, I am no longer pursuing its development. Therefore, you are welcome to use and adapt it for your own projects. Have fun !
